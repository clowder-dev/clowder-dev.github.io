What is Clowder?

Clowder is an open-source (_true_ open source, Apache 2.0 license) software framework for
deploying, operating and managing AI models at scale.

Clowder can be run on _any_ physical or virtual machine. Like any AI platform,
it runs best when dedicated chips, such as GPUs, TPUs, or other accelerators, are available.
